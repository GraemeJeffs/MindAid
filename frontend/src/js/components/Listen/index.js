          Is there any thing that helps when you are feeling like this? Is there
          anyone you are close to who you can talk to about this? This is
          something people often go through â€“ would you like some more
          information about it? Would you like to talk about this again? This
          sounds really important and something you need help with shall we book
          an appointment for you to talk to your personal advisor/the school
          counsellor/me again?
